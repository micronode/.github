Software make the world go around! We love software, but it's hard to get right. We believe that software longevity
and interoperability are key to a good software strategy, and can lead you to a happy place for you and your teams.

## Everyone needs Open Source

Let's face it, you cannot have a software strategy without Open Source. But many organizations, including very large ones,
don't keep a managed inventory of Open Source projects that are critical to their applications and infrastructure. This is
a concern not only for the potential for unidentified security incidents, but the health and longevity of these projects
can be hugely important in both financial and stability concerns.

### Inner Source

Whilst the benefits of Open Source are clear, sometimes you cannot make your source code public. But that doesn't mean you can't
benefit from Open Source principles between your internal teams. Inner Source focuses on better team sharing and integration
within large organizations.

## Build-run-operate with DevOps

Whether you are managing customer-facing or internal applications, DevOps teams are cheaper and more efficient that silo'ed
IT functions.

### Platform Engineering

As the concerns of operating workloads continue to grow, DevOps can become overwhelming for many developers. The cognitive load
can be reduced by centralised key functions that focus on key pillars of good architecture, such as security, resiliency and
efficiency.
